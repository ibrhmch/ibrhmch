### Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ibrahim

_pronouns: He/Him/His_



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently voluntarily working as the only developer on a private project for a Fire Alarm Systems company based in New York. For a quick review: In this project I am automating boring work that involves manually downloading documents from a website, extracting data from them, generating reports and sending emails to clients. The techstack includes: MS Azure, MS Graph API, Python, Selenium etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning application design techniques, software version management and cloud services.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that automates a task and makes someones life a bit easier.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also looking for a job to start after I graduate in May, 2024.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about getting stuck in a coding problem and how to find your way out of it.
